# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a project aimed at detecting credit card fraud using various machine learning models. The goal was to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and minimal false positives. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights from the results.

## Features
- **Models Used:** 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Isolation Forest (anomaly detection)
- **Key Techniques:**
  - Feature scaling and selection to enhance model performance.
  - Evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), containing anonymized transaction details and a class label indicating fraud. Due to the large size of the dataset, please download from Kaggle to replicate.

## Results
- Each model was assessed based on precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- Isolation Forest was used for unsupervised anomaly detection, offering insights into fraud patterns.


## Usage
1. Download the datafile.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run R file.
